# RAG-learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LM Studio. RAG is a technique that combines retrieval of relevant documents with generative AI models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. It is particularly useful for tasks like question answering, summarization, and knowledge-based generation.

## What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a hybrid approach that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge retrieval. The process involves:
1. Retrieving relevant documents or data from an external source (e.g., a database or search index).
2. Feeding the retrieved information into a generative model to produce a response.

This approach helps overcome the limitations of LLMs, such as outdated knowledge or hallucination, by grounding the generation process in real-world data.

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:
- **LM Studio**: A local environment for running and fine-tuning language models.
- **Python**: For backend logic and integration.
- **Vector Database**: To store and retrieve embeddings for document search.
- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications with LLMs, including retrieval and generation pipelines.
- **OpenAI API (optional)**: For leveraging external LLMs if needed.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- LM Studio (download from [LM Studio's official website](https://lmstudio.ai))
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Starfall0/RAG-learning.git
   cd rag-learning
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Place your documents in the `data/` folder.
   - Use the provided script to preprocess and generate embeddings:
     ```bash
     python populate_database.py
     ```

4. **Run LM Studio**
   - Open LM Studio and load your preferred language model.
   - Configure LM Studio to accept API requests (refer to LM Studio's documentation for setup).

5. **Start the Application**
   Run the main script to start the RAG pipeline:
   ```bash
   python query_data.py "your question"
   ```

6. **Test the Application**
   Use the provided interface or API endpoint to query the system. The application will retrieve relevant documents and generate responses using the loaded model.

## How It Works

1. **Document Embedding**: Documents are converted into vector embeddings using a pre-trained model.
2. **Retrieval**: When a query is made, the system retrieves the most relevant documents from the vector database.
3. **Generation**: The retrieved documents are passed to the language model in LM Studio to generate a response.

## Additional Notes

- For advanced use cases, you can fine-tune the language model in LM Studio with your dataset.
- The project is modular, allowing you to swap components like the vector database or LLM.
